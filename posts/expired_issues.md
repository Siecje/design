title: How long is an Issue still good?

How long is a bug/feature report still good? What?! We are not talking about milk, a valid report shouldn't become too old that is it no longer valid.

Managing issues is an important part of open source development. When triaging issues you need to make sure that an issue is actionable and within the scope of the project. If you are creating an Android app and someone suggests that it should be ported to Windows and that is not currently part of the roadmap, that issue should be closed. Even if you think that it might happen someday maybe.

Closing issues after a certain amount of time causes several problems. 

#### It encourages duplicate issues
Before I create an issue I will search open issues to see if it has already been reported. I'm not going to search closed issues because even if I found it, it may have been fixed and there is a regression. Duplicate issues are a problem because you lose the history of the problem which can help identify when the problem occured.

####It prevents discoverabilitiy
If I'm looking at the issues of a project I'm only going to look at the open issues.

####It can discourage issue contributions
If my issue is valid and not closed initially but is later closed because it has been open for too long. It makes me feel like I was not heard.

The reasons for closing old issues seem to be having less issues to worry about. Less cognitive clutter. Why not filter issues by creation date?

####But duplicate issues are important they let you know the issue is still valid

This is why issue trackers should have a "I have this problem too" button. No one likes "+1 comments", they distract from the discussion.

Displaying issues by the number of votes will reduce duplicates of the most popular issues and allow maintainers too see which features and bugs to work on next.

To reduce the amount of issues to worry about, close issues that are not valid or actionable at this time, and categorize issues that are important and then only worry about those issues.
