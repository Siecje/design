(04:24:51 PM) zeiris: Did I do a Lenovo fun fact before?
(04:28:04 PM) zeiris: Eh, guess not. Fun fact: Lenovo has been shipping adware for years, with silent remote upgrades over HTTP. Adding a MITM cert is their idea of being less intrusive than showing popup ads during powerpoint presentations.
(04:38:00 PM) Siecje: I find it interesting that Lenovo and others think it is a competitive advantage to put software on their computers
(04:38:42 PM) mpy: they get paid to do it, may as well increase their margins
(04:46:19 PM) zeiris: Consumer laptops are extremely low margin.

(04:50:19 PM) Siecje: mpy: Wouldn't it cost more to put software on there?? It's in house software.
(04:50:52 PM) Siecje: Do people really think I need to get the same brand because I liked the photo application it came with? Do people even remember?
(04:51:24 PM) mpy: which in house software
(04:52:58 PM) Siecje: mpy: Acer back up and whatever else come on computers
(04:54:10 PM) mpy: some of the preinstalled software could just be random utilities, stuff like superfish was meant to be adware though
(05:01:37 PM) Zoxc: Siecje: But Photo App 2 with Twitch.tv integration is not the same :(
(05:02:13 PM) Siecje: Zoxc: I don't get the reference.
(05:03:21 PM) Zoxc: The included software changes too often, so even if you liked it you'll get something different the next purchase
(05:11:51 PM) Siecje: Zoxc: True
